# Data filch

A retro arcade action game inspired by a famous Atari 2600 game with the same initials.

## Plot

You play as a industrial spy from _NotGood_ _Inc_, tasked with infiltrating the buildings of _VeryEvil_ _Corp_ to 
steal their data and secrets. Their security systems are top of the line and literally cutting edge. 
Are you a bad enough spy to ~~rescue~~ steal the data? 

## ScreenShots



## Instructions

The game is divided into two screens: 

**Side-View Screen:**
Arrows Keys or D-Pad: Move Left / Right or Crouch.
Z / 1 - Jump

**Top-view Screen:**
Arrows Keys - Move in 8 directions. 

**Scoring:**
In the side view portion, you will be scored by going left, and lose points by backtracking, you can get a D (danger) multiplier, 
if you get really close to the enemy drones without dieing a horrible gory death.

In the top view portion, you will be score by collecting the floppy disks that VeryEvil Corp left laying around, which, 
let's face it, its very convenient for you.
